# About Me
With hands-on experience in both wet lab techniques and high-performance computing, I bridge experimental biology and data-driven modeling to explore complex problems in infectious diseases and drug discovery.

Currently, I’m a Biomedical Informatics & Data Science Intern at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine’s Department of Biomedical Informatics, where I’m exploring ways to translate between molecular structures and natural language using SMILES strings and transformer-based models like MolT5, running large-scale experiments on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. I’ve also contributed to journal club discussions with other interns, built datasets for training and evaluation, and worked with tools like Python, Bash, and GitHub to manage and automate workflow.

I additionally conduct infectious disease research on Legionella pneumophila host-pathogen interactions with amoebae in the Tera Levin Lab at Pitt, combining aseptic techniques and data analysis tools like microscopy and Prism. My lab work is complemented by my experience as a Laboratory Student Intern at UPMC and as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant guiding biology students through experimental design and statistical analysis.

My technical skill set includes culture plating, DNA extraction, PCR, command line (Bash), Python, and Java (in progress), along with professional strengths in teamwork, academic communication, and project management.

Beyond research, I’m passionate about fostering interdisciplinary collaboration as Co-President of the Computational Health Sciences Club, where I organize events connecting students and faculty from biology, computer science, and public health.

Outside of academics, I am a proud Pittsburgh native who enjoys experiencing the city’s vibrant arts and eats scenes, exploring its diverse neighborhoods and parks, and discovering new coffee spots. I love cooking and baking, and sharing the meals and treats with friends and family. In my free time, I enjoy being outside to enjoy nature and take advantage of a (rare) sunny day in Pittsburgh. You may also find me watching the newest crime documentary or playing word games, like Scrabble and Bananagrams!
