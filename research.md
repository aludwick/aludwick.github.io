## *University of Pittsburgh, School of Health and Rehibilitation Sciences*
- in progress
  
## Tera Levin Lab (August 2024 - Present)
## *University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biological Sciences*
- Assisting in conducting research of opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila and its interactions with its environmental host Dicty amoebae under principal investigator Dr. Tera Levin and graduate student Mische Holland
- Managed experimental procedures and their timelines through effectively communicating research progress to the laboratory team, keeping a detailed notebook, and updating the experimental protocols accordingly
- Performed necessary laboratory tasks including culture plating and patching, spot dilutions, and bacterial growth assays while maintaining aseptic technique
- Participated in journal clubs discussing relevant academic journals and reviews related to evolution of infectious diseases

## Viral Genomes (August 2023 - December 2023) 
## *University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biological Sciences*
- Utilized identification of a novel bacteriophage by the SEA-PHAGES program led by Graham Hatfull's group at the University of Pittsburgh and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science Education division
- Characterized newly discovered Phage Charianelly using 8 gene prediction and annotation programs
- Investigated potential biological mechanisms for a bacteriophage’s ability to expand its bacterial host range
- Annotated 15 genes and called the function of 3 genes of Phage Charianelly within a team of 3 peers for publication in the Actinobacteriophage Database and National Library of Medicine

## Duckweed Survivor (January 2023 - April 2023)
## *University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biological Sciences*
- Analyzed the differences in Spirodela polyrhiza's stress resistance to environmental pollutants based on its genetic background under the direction of Martin Turcotte's research laboratory within the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh
- Established experimental procedures for testing and measuring results within a team of four peers
- Tracked quantitative measurements and qualitative observations of the plant's conditions weekly in a laboratory notebook
- Presented a PowerPoint research presentation summarizing experimental methods, data, and conclusions to a panel of experts and peers
